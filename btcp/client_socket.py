    You're implementing the transport layer, exposing it to the application

    To implement the transport layer, you also need to interface with the
    network (lossy) layer. This happens by both calling into it
    (LossyLayer.send_segment) and providing callbacks for it
    (BTCPClientSocket.lossy_layer_segment_received, lossy_layer_tick).

    Your implementation will operate in two threads, the network thread,
    where the lossy layer "lives" and where your callbacks will be called from,
    and the application thread, where the application calls connect, send, etc.
    This means you will need some thread-safe information passing between
    network thread and application thread.
    Writing a boolean or enum attribute in one thread and reading it in a loop
    in another thread should be sufficient to signal state changes.
    Lists, however, are not thread safe, so to pass data and segments around
    you probably want to use Queues, or a similar thread safe collection.

        """Called by the lossy layer whenever a segment arrives.

        Things you should expect to handle here (or in helper methods called
        from here):
            - checksum verification (and deciding what to do if it fails)
            - receiving syn/ack during handshake
            - receiving ack and registering the corresponding segment as being
              acknowledged
            - receiving fin/ack during termination
            - any other handling of the header received from the server

        Remember, we expect you to implement this *as a state machine!*
        You have quite a bit of freedom in how you do this, but we at least
        expect you to *keep track of the state the protocol is in*,
        *perform the appropriate state transitions based on events*, and
        *alter behaviour based on that state*.

        So when you receive the segment, do the processing that is common
        for all states (verifying the checksum, parsing it into header values
        and data...).
        Then check the protocol state, do appropriate state-based processing
        (e.g. a FIN is not an acceptable segment in ACCEPTING state, whereas a
        SYN is).
        Finally, do post-processing that is common to all states.

        You could e.g. implement the state-specific processing in a helper
        function per state, and simply call the appropriate helper function
        based on which state you are in.
        In that case, it will be very helpful to split your processing into
        smaller helper functions, that you can combine as needed into a larger
        function for each state.

        If you are on Python 3.10, feel free to use the match ... case
        statement.
        If you are on an earlier Python version, an if ... elif ...  elif
        construction can be used; just make sure to check the same variable in
        each elif.

        You are free to implement this however you like, but the following
        explanation may help to understand how sockets *usually* behave and you
        may choose to follow this concept as well:

        The way this usually works is that "send" operates on a "send buffer".
        Once (part of) the data has been successfully put "in the send buffer",
        the send method returns the number of bytes it was able to put in the
        buffer. The actual sending of the data, i.e. turning it into segments
        and sending the segments into the lossy layer, happens *outside* of the
        send method (e.g. in the network thread).
        If the socket does not have enough buffer space available, it is up to
        the application to retry sending the bytes it was not able to buffer
        for sending.

        Again, you should feel free to deviate from how this usually works.
        Note that our rudimentary implementation here already chunks the data
        in maximum 1008-byte bytes objects because that's the maximum a segment
        can carry. If a chunk is smaller we do *not* pad it here, that gets
